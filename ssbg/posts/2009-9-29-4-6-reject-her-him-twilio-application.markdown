Yesterday I made <http://rejectherhim.appspot.com/>. It allows you to enter in your phone number and a custom rejection message. The service will also give you a phone number you can then proxy a call through. The best part about it is that with a little social engineering you can make the other person think they are getting your phone number. When you call our proxy number, and enter in the rejectee's 10 digit phone number it will connect the two of you but they will see the caller-id of our service. When they call our number back (because they think it is you) they will be played the custom rejection message.
