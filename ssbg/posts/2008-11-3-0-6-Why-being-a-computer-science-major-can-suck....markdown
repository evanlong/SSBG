...the people. Here is a question somebody asked on a class forum. I really hope they meant to be funny:

Professors response to the acceptable size of paper for notes used during an 
exam:

>Let me clarify.   Two pieces of A4 paper.  Fourth sides.   Hand writing notes.

Students response:

>Hmm... since wikipedia states that A4 paper is '8.3 x 11.7"', I assume this means 8.5 x 11" will also suffice (where do one obtain "A4" paper around here?)

TA's response:

>That is the most ridiculous question I have seen in my 25 years of existence. It even beats some of the other questions one hears in the election rallies these days. My official response to it is that I am going to go off to bed now as I have an early morning lecture to attend.
