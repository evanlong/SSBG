I spent some time this weekend working on my <http://dialthejoke.appspot.com/> application. The idea is certainly not original. I first learned about these systems when I saw [Pirates of Silicon Valley](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0168122/). It accepts user submitted jokes and those jokes are then voted on. The joke with the most votes will be the played when you call **425-440-0035**. 

I built it with <http://www.twilio.com/ and Google App Engine. It's the first 
real app I built with twilio. It only uses the "say" verb so I still have a 
lot to learn about the twilio system. But I do have another app I plan on 
building during the evenings and weekends ahead. It's slightly more 
complicated but I think it will be a bit more amusing.

For those that are interested the source code can be found here: <http://code.google.com/p/dialthejoke/>.
