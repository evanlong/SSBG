I wrote this email to a friend on February 4th, 2008. Just a list of my predictions for the next 5 years:

>So within 5 years I think:

>1. XMPP will be the protocol for real-time web apps
>2. Browsers will have javascript implementations that go through a JIT. Microsoft actually has this working. They have javascript working on their DLR (which is the newer virtual machine for dynamic languages).
>3. People may implement their own virtual machines <span class="nfakPe">in</span> the javascript just so they can easily port existing code to the web. (This point is a big maybe but could be cool)
>4. Erlang will be cool partly because of the XMPP server that is written in erlang.
>5. And facebook will have gone public.

>So now you know and are my witness.

>Evan
