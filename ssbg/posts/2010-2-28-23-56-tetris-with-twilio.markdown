Last month I created [Tetris with Twilio](http://tetris.evanlong.info/). It allows any telephone (USA only) to be used as an input device to a game of tetris that is played within a web browser. The best part is that once you clear 5 lines your phone is redirected to me and I'll probably pick up and talk to you.

How does it work? I use <http://www.twilio.com/> to deal with input from the phone. The main purpose of this project was to learn more about <http://www.tornadoweb.org/>. Tornado makes it easy to push data to the user in realtime. And for those that like source code it is available [here](http://bitbucket.org/evanlong/twilio-tetris-game/).

Enjoy!
