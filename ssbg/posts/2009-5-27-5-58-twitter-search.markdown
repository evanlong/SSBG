Obama nominated [Sotomayor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Sotomayor) to 
the supreme court today but the top twitter trend as of now: [#3wordsaftersex](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%233wordsaftersex) I do understand twitter 
search. So far I actually like twitter search. I find somewhat interesting 
blog posts (on technical things) that I probably would not have found 
otherwise. I don't know what twitter plans to do with search (fight Google?).
I could see how they could win. It would be nice if the searches were sorted 
by "relevance" instead of most recent post. Grouping common tweets together 
and categorizing them might be nice but I honestly don't know if I would like 
that.

The power of these tweets seem to be the links and keywords and the time context. Perhaps mining the tweets would be a better way to [label images](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Image_Labeler)? Or label websites, videos, blogs, and 
news items that the tweets link to.

Just some thoughts. I guess I sort of get twitter now.
