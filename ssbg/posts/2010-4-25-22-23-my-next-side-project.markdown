For my next side project I am going to create a webapp that allows site maintainers to track what a user is doing with the UI of their site and view this in realtime. My plan is to record things like mouse position, window size and page content and push it all back to the server. It can be a poor man's usability study or simply used as a big brother tool by site maintainers. Either way it should be interesting.
