I have been busy this past week but I got a chance to create a new chipmark feature. It's not actually on your our <https://www.chipmark.com> server but I wrote an app Google App Engine that downloads your public bookmarks and puts them in an RSS feed. The downside of the app is that users must provide there username and password. It would be nice if we implemented OAuth on Chipmark so third party apps could be allowed access to the account without the user having to give their password away to the app. One goal this past year was to implement mashups with chipmark. Currently, we do not have a method that allow users to expose their public chipmarks. For right now the app engine app is the only way to embed a feed of your chipmarks in a website. Take a look at the sidebar and you'll see some of my recent chipmarks.

I should mention I thought of doing this after seeing this in my feed reader yesterday: [remote torrent](http://torrentfreak.com/automate-your-bittorrent-downloads-with-mininova-bookmarks-080709/).
